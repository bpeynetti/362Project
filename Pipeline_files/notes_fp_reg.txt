new signals

out of control:
	FPRegWrite = mul | movi2fp
	FPRType (that' just an opcode 000001)
	movi2fp, movfp2i and output 
	
	changed RegWrite to be movfp2i or normal RType and ~movi2fp 
	wired these all to outputs of the ID stage directly
	
----
top level 
	added signals for FPRType, FPRegWrite for id stage and wired into the ID_EX_REG
	added signals for movfp2i,movi2fp out of id stage, into ID_EX REG
	
	new ID_EX_REG: f1_id (32), f2_id(32), destFReg_id (5), control signals for the floating point (FPRType,FPRegWrite,movfp2i,movi2fp)
		total: 64 + 5 + 4 = 73 more bits
		
	added to all pipeline registers, the parameter that is iset in lines 67 of the top_level.v
	
exec stage
	wired from the top level to the execution stage. 
	wired outputs of the execution stage to top level
		TODO: wire signals into EX_MEM register, then to the MEM_WB register and in the WB stage to the FPRegFile
